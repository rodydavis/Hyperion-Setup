## Important Notes
- On this configuration with the WS2812b lights I had to set the order from RGB to GRB.

- In order to get Hyperion talking with FastLED I needed to needed to set my Light Type to ADALight.

  How to find device path (Output) in Hypercon...
  
  1. SSH into Rasberry PI
  2. Run Command "lsusb"
  3. Run Command "ls /dev"
  
  You should see the arduino listed. If not run the command without the arduino plugged in, then again with it plugged in.
  
- You need to use the V2 Grabber and adjust the crop borders

- MAKE SURE YOU CORRECTLY SPECIFIY THE LED DIRECTION

All of the componets run off 1 5V 10A Powersource. The HDMI Splitter is actually powered from the input and even with this setup my Xbox One S will still turn on and off my TV no problem. All of the components fit in a IKEA tool box that comes with Zip Ties.

In the Amazon list I included a LED strip extender, had I known this at the time of the build i would not have wasted 4 hours soldering the LED Strips on my TV on my bed.
